[xdg-launch -- release notes.  2021-12-12]: #

Maintenance Release 1.11
========================

This is another stable release of the xdg-launch package that provides a
"C"-language program that can be used to launch XDG desktop applications
with full startup notification and window manager assistance from the
command line.  The command is able to launch desktop applications,
autostart entries and xsession entries.

This release is a maintenance release that updates the build system and
fixes compilation with extra warning flags.  Preferred application
handling is improved with new tag for suppressing run history for
desktop entries about to be chained.  Preferred application desktop
files are now usable and added to menus.

Included in the release is an autoconf tarball for building the package
from source.  See the [NEWS](NEWS) and [TODO](TODO) file in the release
for more information.  Please report problems to the issues list on
[GitHub](https://github.com/bbidulock/xdg-launch/issues).
