=head1 NAME

xdg-prefs - locate and set preferred desktop applications

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<xdg-prefs> [I<options>] {-p,--pref} [--] I<APPID>[B<;>...] [I<TYPE> [...]]

B<xdg-prefs> [I<options>] {-e,--exec} [--] I<TYPE>

B<xdg-prefs> [I<options>] {-l,--list} [--] I<TYPE> [...]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<xdg-prefs> operates in two modes: (1) locates preferred applications
by category or mime type; and (2) sets preferred applications by
category or mime type.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

The program accepts the following arguments:

=over

=item I<APPID>[B<;>...]

Specifies the application identifier of an XDG desktop application to
locate.  The application identifier, I<APPID>, can be one of the
following:

=over

=item 1.

the name of a desktop entry file without the F<.desktop> suffix (e.g.
C<gvim>); the name may contain a C</> if it is specified relative to a
user or system application directory, in which case it must not start
with a C</> or C<.>.

=item 2.

the name of a desktop entry file with the F<.desktop> suffix (e.g.
C<gvim.desktop>); the same restrictions as (1), above, apply; or,

=item 3.

the full path (absolute or relative) and filename of a desktop entry
file (e.g.  F</usr/share/applications/gvim.desktop>); the full path must
contain at least one C</> and start with either a C</> or a C<.>.

=back

Additional application identifiers and option actions can be listed
separated by semi-colons (C<;>).

Providing a non-option application identifier argument is mandatory when
the B<--pref> option is specified.

=item I<TYPE>

Specifies the type of application for which to show or set I<APPID>
as the preferred application.  The application type, I<TYPE>, can be one
of the following:

=over

=item 1.

A recognized XDG category name.  For recognized XDG category names, see
L</XDG CATEGORIES>.

=item 2.

A mime (content) type.  All mime types have a C</> in their names and
are thus distinguished from XDG categories.  The content type cannot
contain wild cards (i.e. it cannot contain C<*>).

=back

=back

=head1 OPTIONS

The options that are detailed below are recognized by B<xdg-prefs>.
B<xdg-which> uses L<getopt_long_only(3)>, so unambiguous abbreviations
of long options and long options with a single dash are also supported.

=head2 COMMAND OPTIONS

One of the following command options must be specified to set the
command mode:

=over

=item B<-p>, B<--pref> [--] I<APPID> [I<TYPE> [...]]

Specifies that I<APPID> is to be used as the default or preferred
application for I<TYPE>.

=item B<-e>, B<--exec> [--] I<TYPE>

=item B<-l>, B<--list> [--] I<TYPE> [...]

=item B<-h>, B<--help>, B<-H>, B<-?>, B<--?>

=item B<-V>, B<--version>

=item B<-C>, B<--copying>

=back

=head2 GENERAL OPTIONS

The following general options are recognized:

=over

=item B<-r>, B<--recommend>

When listing, launching or setting preferred applications, use the
recommended application instead of the default application for the given
type.

=back

associations and removed associations.  Files are searched in the
following order:

=over

This file is desktop environment specific.
Only considered for defaults and not associations.

=item F<$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mimeapps.list>

Considered for both defaults and associations.
