=head1 NAME

xdg-find - find desktop entries by criteria

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<xdg-find> [I<options>] [--] I<TYPE> [...]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<xdg-find> takes one or more arguments.  For each of its arguments, it
locates all desktop entries of the specified types and lists them on
standard output.  It does this by searching for a desktop entry in the
appropriate sub-directories of the C<XDG_CONFIG_DIRS>,
C<XDG_CONFIG_HOME>, C<XDG_DATA_DIRS> and C<XDG_DATA_HOME> environment
variables using the same algorithms as L<xdg-launch(1)>.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

The program accepts the following arguments:

=over

=item I<TYPE>

Specifies the type of application for which to show or set I<APPID>
as the preferred application.  The application type, I<TYPE>, can be one
of the following:

=over

=item 1.

A recognized XDG category name.  For recognized XDG category names, see
L</XDG CATEGORIES>.

=item 2.

A mime (content) type.  All mime types have a C</> in their names and
are thus distinguished from XDG categories.  The content type cannot
contain wild cards (i.e. it cannot contain C<*>).

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

The following environment variables are examined by B<xdg-find>:

=over

=item B<HOME>

Used by B<xdg-find> to determine the user's home directory.

=item B<XDG_DATA_HOME>

Used by B<xdg-find> to determine the user's XDG data directory.  This
defaults to F<$HOME/.local/share>.  The F<applications> (or
F<xsessions>) subdirectory under this directory is the first searched to
locate desktop entry files.  See the XDG Desktop Entry file
specification for more information.

=item B<XDG_DATA_DIRS>

Used by B<xdg-find> to determine the system XDG data directories.
This defaults to F</usr/local/share:/usr/share>.  The F<applications>
(or F<xsessions>) subdirectory under these directories are searched in
order to locate desktop entry files.  See the XDG Desktop Entry file
specification for more information.

=item B<XDG_CONFIG_HOME>

Used by B<xdg-find> to determin the user's XDG configuration directory.
This defaults to F<$HOME/.config>.  The F<autostart> subdirectory under
this directory is the first searched to locate desktop entry files.  See
the XDG Desktop Entry file specification for more information.

=item B<XDG_CONFIG_DIRS>

Used by B<xdg-find> to determine the system XDG configuration
directories.  This defaults to F</etc/xdg>.  The F<autostart>
subdirectory under these directories are searched in order to locate
desktop entry files.  See the XDG Desktop Entry file specification for
more information.
