- [ ] there should be a way to specify the terminal to use in a
      configuration file instead of just using xterm
- [X] terminal applications should set the WMCLASS instance to that of
      the application instead of, for example, "xterm".
- [.] should observe the informal "AsRoot=true" keyword: perhaps
      behavior can be somewhat different based on "Terminal=" (i.e.
      sudo in command vs. gksu or equivalent).
- [X] should add a wait-for-window-manager option that waits for a
      window manager whenever a WMCLASS would be used
- [X] similarly, could add a wait-for-systray and wait-for-pager option
- [ ] make xdg-which and xdg-types work without gio-unix-2.0
