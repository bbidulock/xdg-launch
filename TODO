xdg-launch -- todo file.  2016-07-08

General tasks:

* [x] handle XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP that has multiple fields separated by ':'
* [x] handle applications desktop entry file id's correctly
* [x] handle Desktop Action and provide option to launch specified action
* [ ] handle DBusName and DBusPath for dbus launching
* [x] make xdg-launch register with .recently-used and .recently-used.xbel
* [x] make xdg-launch use GtkRecentManager object
* [x] make xdg-launch also use ~/.config/xde/run-history
* [x] make xdg-launch also use ~/.config/xde/recent-applications
* [x] make xdg-launch use XML Simple from glib instead of gtk2
* [x] make xdg-launch use GBookmarkFile from glib instead of gtk2

* [ ] there should be a way to specify the terminal to use in a
      configuration file instead of just using xterm
* [x] terminal applications should set the WMCLASS instance to that of
      the application instead of, for example, "xterm".
* [ ] should observe the informal "AsRoot=true" keyword: perhaps
      behavior can be somewhat different based on "Terminal=" (i.e.
      sudo in command vs. gksu or equivalent).
* [x] should add a wait-for-window-manager option that waits for a
      window manager whenever a WMCLASS would be used
* [x] similarly, could add a wait-for-systray and wait-for-pager option
* [ ] make xdg-which and xdg-types work without gio-unix-2.0

xdg-prefs:

* [ ] actually read and write mime and category key files and don't
  just use gio.
