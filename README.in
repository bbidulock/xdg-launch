==========

Package @PACKAGE@-@VERSION@ was release under GPLv3 license @DATE@.

This is a "C"-language program that can be used to launch XDG desktop
applications with full startup notification and window manager
assistance from the command line.  The source is hosted on GitHub at
(http://github.com/bbidulock/@PACKAGE@).  What it includes is just
the @PACKAGE@ program and manual page, as well as a handfull of wrapper
scripts.

Release
-------

This is the @PACKAGE@-@VERSION@ package, released @DATE@.  This release,
and the latest version, can be obtained from the GitHub repository at
(http://github.com/bbidulock/@PACKAGE@), using a command such as:

    $> git clone http://github.com/bbidulock/@PACKAGE@.git

Please see the `NEWS' file for release notes and history of user visible
changes for the current version, and the `ChangeLog' file for a more
detailed history of implementation changes.  The `TODO' file lists
features not yet implemented and other outstanding items.  The file
`COMPLIANCE' lists the current state of XDG compliance.

Please see the `INSTALL' file for installation instructions.

When working from `git(1)', follow the instructions in this file.  An
abbreviated installation procedure that works for most applications
appears below.

This release is published under the GPLv3 license that can be found in
the file `COPYING'.

Quick Start:
------------

The quickest and easiest way to get @PACKAGE@ up and running is to run
the following commands:

    $> git clone https://github.com/bbidulock/@PACKAGE@.git @PACKAGE@
    $> cd @PACKAGE@
    $> ./autogen.sh
    $> ./configure --prefix=/usr --mandir=/usr/share/man
    $> make V=0
    $> make DESTDIR="$pkgdir" install

This will configure, compile and install @PACKAGE@ the quickest.  For
those who like to spend the extra 15 seconds reading ./configure --help,
some compile time options can be turned on and off before the build.
@PACKAGE@, however, does not provide any compile time options of its
own.

For general information on GNU's ./configure, see the file `INSTALL'.

Running @PACKAGE@
-----------------

Read the manual page after installation: man @PACKAGE@.
