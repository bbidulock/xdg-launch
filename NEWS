    This is another stable release of the xdg-launch package that provides

    This release is a maintenance release that updates the build system,
    generates a better NEWS file, handles annotated tags better, and
    converts the release archives to lzip complression.

    In addition to build improvements, this release includes the ability to
    select the terminal emulation program that is used to run desktop
    applications that specify Terminal=true in their desktop entry files,
    using environment variables. Baring selection, it will search for
    available terminal emulation programs from a long list of popular ones
    and select the first one found.

    from source. See the NEWS and TODO file in the release for more
    information. Please report problems to the issues list on GitHub.
