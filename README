This is the xdg-launch-0.1.13 package, released 2014-01-27.  This release,
and the latest version, can be obtained from the GitHub repository at
(http://github.com/bbidulock/xdg-launch), using a command such as:

    $> git clone http://github.com/bbidulock/xdg-launch.git

Please see the `NEWS' file for release notes and history of user visible

abbreviated installation procedure that works for most applications
appears below.

This release is published under the GPLv3 license that can be found in
the file `COPYING'.

Quick Start:
------------

The quickest and easiest way to get xdg-launch up and running is to run
the following commands:

    $> git clone http://github.com/bbidulock/xdg-launch.git xdg-launch
    $> cd xdg-launch
    $> ./autogen.sh
    $> ./configure --prefix=/usr --mandir=/usr/share/man
    $> make V=0
    $> make DESTDIR="$pkgdir" install

This will configure, compile and install xdg-launch the quickest.  For
those who like to spend the extra 15 seconds reading ./configure --help,
some compile time options can be turned on and off before the build.
xdg-launch, however, does not provide any compile time options of its
own.

For general information on GNU's ./configure, see the file `INSTALL'.

Running xdg-launch
-----------------

Read the manual page after installation: man xdg-launch.
