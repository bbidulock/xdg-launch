xdg-launch
===============

Package `xdg-launch-1.11` was released under GPLv3 license
2021-12-12.

This is a "C"-language program that can be used to launch XDG desktop
applications with full startup notification and window manager
assistance from the command line.  The command is able to launch desktop
applications, autostart entries and xsession entries.  It is useful when
generating applications root menus for light-weight window managers that
do not provide startup notification for applications launched using the
keyboard or root menu.

The source for `xdg-launch` is hosted on [GitHub][1].

Features
--------

The following programs are included in `xdg-launch`:

 - [__`xdg-launch(1)`__][11] -- This is the primary program.

 - [__`dmenu_launch(1)`__][12] -- This is a little script that uses
   `xdg-launch(1)` and dmenu(1) to provide an application menu.

 - [__`xdg-autostart(1)`__][13] -- This is a little script that invokes
   xdg-launch(1) as a launcher for auto-start programs instead of
   applications.

 - [__`xdg-xsession(1)`__][14] -- This is a little script that invokes
   `xdg-launch(1)` as a launcher for X Sessions programs (window
   managers) instead of applications.

 - [__`xdg-session(1)`__][15] -- This is a little script that invokes
   `xdg-launch(1)` as a launcher for X Sessions programs (window
   managers) instead of applications a simple session and full
   auto-start procedure.

 - [__`xdg-entry(1)`__][16] -- This is a little script that invokes
   xdg-launch(1)` with the --info option and lists which information
   would be used for startup notification and launching of the resulting
   application.

 - [__`xdg-toolwait(1)`__][17] -- This is a little script that invokes
   `xdg-launch(1)` with the --toolwait option.

 - [__`xdg-which(1)`__][18], [__`xdg-whereis(1)`__][19] -- Two little
 programs what
   parallel `which(1)` and `whereis(1)` for desktop entry files instead
   of binaries.

 - [__`xdg-assist(1)`__][20] -- A program to monitor startup notification and
   provide notification as programs start up and performs startup
   notification completion of applications that do not complete.  It
   also assists window managers with supporting startup notification and
   other EWMH/NetWM features.

 - [__`xdg-list(1)`__][21] -- lists desktop entry files.

 - [__`xdg-types(1)`__][22] -- shows the content types provided by a desktop
   application.

Also provided (when `glib2` is available) are some little tools for the
XDG desktop:

 - [__`xdg-find(1)`__][23] -- finds desktop entry files based on a number of
   search criteria.

 - [__`xdg-prefs(1)`__][24] -- locates or sets preferred applications by
   category or mime type.
